# Comet Components Core

Comet Components is a PHP-driven web UI component library initially developed as an abstraction layer for WordPress blocks, with the intention of being able to use the same components in other projects.

It is built with PHP using an object-oriented architecture where each component is passed an array of `$attributes` and in most cases, either a string of `$content` or an array of component objects called `$innerComponents`.

Documentation can be found at [cometcomponents.io](https://cometcomponents.io/docs/).
